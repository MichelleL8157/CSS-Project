        <h2>Ways You Can Help</h2>
        <p>
            There are many organizations running in NYC that aim to help the homeless and the best
            way to help is by volunteering or donating to their caus to reach out to more people in 
            need. There are more homeless people than the organizations and charities can 
            distribute to, so donating directly to the homeless in the parks or streets of NYC is 
            always encouraged!
        </p>
        <p class="important">
            It doesn't matter how much you can donate or contribute; any help is welcomed!
        </p>
        <h3>You can donate:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>loose change</li>
            <li>used socks</li>
            <li>canned food</li>
            <li>bottles of water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Spreading Awareness</h2>
        <p>
            There have been protests and news regarding anti-homeless architecture that aim to
            prohibit people from sleeping in public spaces, but this only adds onto to the problem 
            as those who can't go to a shelter will have no where safe to rest. It's highly encouraged
            to spread awareness of these government and private companies' actions against the people 
            of NYC!

                <td>The Bowery Mission serves homeless and hungry New Yorkers and provides services 
                    that meet their immediate needs and transforms their lives from poverty and 
                    hopelessness to hope.

                    The Ali Forney Center was founded in 2002 in memory of Ali Forney, a homeless 
                    gender-nonconforming youth who was  forced to live on the streets, where they were 
                    tragically murdered. Committed to saving the lives of LGBTQ+ young people, our mission 
                    is to protect them from the harms of homelessness and empower them with the tools 
                    needed to live independently.

                    paid work, career training, and supportive services.
